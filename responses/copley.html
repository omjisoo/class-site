            <div class="comment">This website makes me anxious. It exactly captures today's social media world where it feels like someone is constantly waiting for your response/attention, multiple conversations are going on all at once, while I'm impatiently waiting for the sentences to come up.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="response-box">
            <div class="quote" style="margin-top:0">This semi-immediate form of talking, in which every line can be revised until it is sent, is the definitive characteristic of so-called instant messaging.
            </div>
            <div class="comment">That's what's so good and dangerous about online chat; you can think over your words before you "say" them out loud and it enables you to mask or make up any emotion you are genuinely feeling at the moment.

            Many users will not wait more than a few seconds for content to load online. Anything longer than this breeds great frustration. <div class="quote">In the realm of person-to-person interaction, however, the rules appear to change. Boredom is often replaced by anticipation. With the ellipsis, hesitation in response is indicated visually, and in real time, with interlocutors left to speculate on each other’s motives. <div class="quote" style="font-size:18px;">Dialogue online therefore exists in a form of space-time discontinuum.</div>
          </div>
          </div>
          <div class="comment">In real life conversation I dread that this anticipation will turn into an awkward silence when I am not able to provide a response or reaction in time. It is one of the biggest fears in my current life.</div>

        <div class="response-box" style="margin-top:10px;margin-left:30px">
          <div class="quote" style="margin-top:-30px">It’s well understood that we put on many voices or masks when broadcasting online, but what does this mean within the space of a personal chat where some ‘genuine’ character is expected?</div>
          <div class="comment">I sometimes feel uneasy at this disparity between what is being said on the chat and what I'm actually doing just outside the screen. While I'm laughing my ass off on chat, I might be emotionally neutral and expressionless in reality.</div>
          <div class="quote">At what point does a group chat grow so large that it is no longer an intimate interaction, and how do the multiple personas enacted within a single social media network mesh with a user’s wider social media ecology?</div>
          <div class="comment">I'm in this graphic designers' group chat with 960+ people and I rarely speak up there. I'm just an onlooker. My notifications are jacked up and I go in there periodically if I'm feeling bored. Amongst these graphic designers that range from students to CEOs, I feel intimidated to answer a question or pose a question even, as if I'm not qualified enough.</div>

          <div class="comment">Yes, just as I had said in previous readings, I forget all these social media platforms are products of corporations, not so much different from Walmart or Apple. We have to use with caution.</div>
