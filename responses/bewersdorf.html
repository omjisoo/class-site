          <div class="comment">While I relate more to INFOmonks' use of the web, the author assumes an air of superiority by calling other users "brats" based on a usage pattern that is different from his. Hey, we're all just different kinds of users, that's all.</div>

          <div class="comment">I easily get lost surfing the web. I feel as if my soul gets sucked through the eternal wormhole of the web. I'm sure a lot of people experience this - hyperlinks from an article, Wikipedia pages, a Google search after another, a stream of Youtube videos...<br><br> <div class="comment" style="border: 2px dotted yellow;">One day I want to keep track of this wondrous process of how I got to one point from the other. Not just a browsing history, but keywords and thought processes.<br><br>
          <div class="comment" style="border: 2px dotted yellow;">It's good when I want to empty out my mind for a while in order to get back into focus on my tasks. It's bad when I get too distracted and instead fall through the quicksand.<br><br> <div class="comment" style="border: 2px dotted yellow;">Sometimes I feel as if<br> I devour and devour on images and information until there's no more satisfaction and I look up from the computer at last. It's probably similar to stress-eating, caused by the stress of the real task at hand. </div></div></div></div>

          <div class="comment">For some of the material I see on Spirit Surfers website, I don't understand why they are there or why they were chosen. The truth must be vivid to the collector but will never be known to a viewer like me. <br><br>That is the eternal question in the art world as well, and something I'm concerned about as an artist and a viewer.<br><br>As an artist: What if no one understands my work?<br><br>As a viewer: I don't understand this artist's work. What now?<br><br>I guess we would all have to shrug and move on at that point.</div>
