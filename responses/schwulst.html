            <div class="quote" style="margin-top:0">Although they may seem initially accommodating and convenient to their users, universally popular social media sites — like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest — are <span class="highlight-text">private companies</span> that prioritize advertising above their users’ needs. Their users’ happiness is not the primary focus, so it’s perfectly normal for you to feel anxiety when using or even thinking about social media.</div>

          In an age of information overload, a room is comforting because it’s finite, often with a specific intended purpose.</div>

          “Metaphor unites <span class="highlight-text" style="padding-right:0">reason and imagination,</span>” says George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their book, Metaphors We Live By (1980).
          <div class="quote" style="font-size:18px;">“Metaphors are not merely things to be seen beyond. In fact, one can see beyond them only by using other metaphors.
            <div class="quote" style="font-size:18px;">It is as though the ability to comprehend experience through metaphor were a sense, like seeing or touching or hearing, with metaphors providing the only ways to perceive and experience much of the world.
              <div class="quote" style="font-size:18px;">Metaphor is as much a part of our functioning as our sense of touch, and as precious.”
