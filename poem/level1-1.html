<p>Baby Ate a Microchip</p>
<p>by Neal Levin</p>

<br>

<p>Baby ate a microchip,</p>
<p>Then grabbed a bottle, took a sip.</p>
<p>He swallowed it and made a beep,</p>
<p>And now he’s thinking pretty deep.</p>

<br>

<p>He’s downloading his ABCs
<p>And calculating 1-2-3s.</p>
<p>He’s memorizing useless facts</p>
<p>While doing Daddy’s income tax.</p>

<br>

<p>He’s processing, and now he thrives</p>
<p>On feeding his internal drives.</p>
<p>He’s throwing fits, and now he fights</p>
<p>With ruthless bits and toothless bytes.</p>

<br>

<p>He must be feeling very smug.</p>
<p>But hold on, Baby caught a bug.</p>
<p>Attempting to reboot in haste,</p>
<p>He accidentally got erased!</p>
